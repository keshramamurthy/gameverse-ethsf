# Gameverse

A chatbot built on XMTPâ€™s Converse app, SKALE Network and AirDAO that integrates a currency-based game system as well as an auction mechanism for group chats.

## How to use:

Run `npm i` in this folder and then `npm run dev` to start the bot.

Make sure the necessary contracts are deployed on-chain.

Populate `.env` with the fields:
KEY=
FRAMES_URL=

In `/frames-server`, run `npm i` and `npm run dev` to start the frames server.
